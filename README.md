### Yale-NUS Capstone Project 

#### Summary
HOMIE is a project aimed at empowering foreign domestic workers in Singapore. The application will provide users with work management tools, inform them of their legal rights and help them reach out to local NGOs.

Features include: 
- A forum service
- Content feeds
- A map-based friend locator
- A one-touch helpline system
- A translator (especially relevant for workers involved in eldercare)
- To-do lists with alarms and timers


#### Setup

* `npm`, `bower` and `gulp` are required. 
* In order for your file to run, a `server/env/dev.js` file has to be created. It should contain all relevant application/third-party API secrets and keys, as well as your database URI. 
* After cloning the repo, be sure to set up with `npm install` and `bower install`. 
* Run `gulp`. Once `Finished default...` is logged, terminate the process with `Ctrl-C`.
* Now run `npm start` on the same terminal. The application can then be viewed on localhost:8080. 
* The application is not meant for the traditional Desktop view. It is best viewed in Device Mode, which you can access through Chrome's Developer Tools (F12).
