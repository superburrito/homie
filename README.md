### Yale-NUS Capstone Project 

#### Summary
HOMIE is a progressive web application that exists to empower migrant domestic workers in Singapore. Its features aim to promote community engagement, information dissemination (e.g. legal rights, ministry guidelines, social events) and work effectiveness.

This project is a college capstone submission.

Features include: 
- A forum service
- Two content feeds
- A messenger service
- A map-based friend locator
- A one-touch helpline system
- A translator (especially relevant for workers involved in eldercare)
- A task manager with alarms and timers


#### Setup

* `npm`, `bower` and `gulp` are required. 
* In order for your file to run, a `server/env/dev.js` file has to be created. It should contain all relevant application/third-party API secrets and keys, as well as your database URI. 
* After cloning the repo, be sure to set up with `npm install` and `bower install`. 
* Run `gulp`. Once `Finished default...` is logged, terminate the process with `Ctrl-C`.
* Now run `npm start` on the same terminal. The application can then be viewed on localhost:8080. 
* The application is not meant for the traditional Desktop view. It is best viewed in Device Mode, which you can access through Chrome's Developer Tools (F12).
